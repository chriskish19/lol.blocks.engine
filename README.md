# lol.blocks.engine
### main idea
<p>

A game engine that is designed to be run from powershell scripts.
It will be similar to minecraft but with no player in the game.
You interact with the world by writing code that can cause changes to the world, building or destroying blocks and physics.

</p>

### details

<li>The core api will be a dll that links to an exe that accepts commands(strings) at launch.</li>
<li>The graphics api will be dx11 and the base api will be win32.</li>
<li>Use an editor to write the script. I would use vscode since it has powershell built in. Then launch a custom cmdlet written for lol.blocks.engine.core.</li>
<li>Ill write all the powershell classes needed as modules that will get included into the main script.</li>
<li>everything is from scratch and im only one guy give this 5-8 years atleast.
